# FilmQuery Project

## Description
FilmQuery is an application focused on database interaction, offering a platform for users to explore a mock film database. This database encompasses various tables, including actors and films. Users can conveniently search for films using keywords or their IDs. This project features two distinct versions: a Command-Line Interface (CLI) version and a JavaFX Graphical User Interface (GUI) version. The CLI version is interacted with via the terminal, while the GUI version provides a window-based interface. The purpose of these two versions is to demonstrate the differences in user interaction and to facilitate learning JavaFX, which has been a point of interest. The project was an enjoyable experience, especially using JDBC to interact with the database.

## Tools Used
The database system utilizes MySQL and JDBC, implemented following the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern. The CLI front-end is designed with an event queue and modular menu systems, drawing inspiration from the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. For JavaFX, the existing CLI code was adapted to a GUI framework.

## Lessons Learned
Key learnings include leveraging SQL's flexibility and the database's capabilities to optimize processing. Efforts were made to practice conservative querying, focusing on loading only what is essential when needed.
